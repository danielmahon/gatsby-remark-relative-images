# gatsby-remark-relative-images

Convert image src(s) in markdown/html/frontmatter to be relative to their node's parent directory. This will help [gatsby-remark-images](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-remark-images) match images outside the node folder. This was built for use with NetlifyCMS and should be considered a temporary solution until relative paths are supported. If it works for other use cases then great!

### Features

- [x] Converts markdown/mdx images
- [x] Converts `src` in markdown/mdx html `<img />` tags
- [x] Converts frontmatter fields, supports nested fields
- [x] Suports Unicode characters
- [x] Frontmatter field filters (include/exclude)

## v2 Breaking Changes:

The `fmImagesToRelative()` function has been removed, it is no longer needed.

NOTE: v2 greatly simplifies things and seems to work well for my use-case (NetlifyCMS), if you were previously using this plugin for something else that no longer works with v2, please open an issue and let me know and I will try to accomodate your use-case. Thanks.

## Install

```bash
# Install v2 (Recommended)
yarn add gatsby-remark-relative-images

# Install v1 (TS refactor, but quickly found more things to simplfy, skip)
npm i gatsby-remark-relative-images@1.1.1

# Install original (a bit hacky but have previously worked for most)
npm i gatsby-remark-relative-images@0.3.0
npm i gatsby-remark-relative-images@0.2.0
```

## Usage Example

This usage example is for v2 of this plugin.

/gatsby-config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // Add static assets before markdown files
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/static/uploads`,
        name: 'uploads',
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/pages`,
        name: 'pages',
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
      options: {
        plugins: [
          // gatsby-remark-relative-images must go before gatsby-remark-images
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-relative-images`,
            options: {
              // [Optional] The root of "media_folder" in your config.yml
              // Defaults to "static"
              staticFolderName: 'static',
              // [Optional] Include the following fields, use dot notation for nested fields
              // All fields are included by default
              include: ['featured'],
              // [Optional] Exclude the following fields, use dot notation for nested fields
              // No fields are excluded by default
              exclude: ['featured.skip'],
              // [Optional] in case you want to process markdown nodes that were not created from a file
              // you can provide a resolver function which produces the absolute path for a given node.
              // In the example below the remarkNode was a child node of a fileNode. E.g. if you have
              // markdown content in your frontmatter fields.
              resolveNodePath: ({ node, getNode }) => {
                let fileAbsolutePath = undefined;
                let curNode = node;
                while (curNode.parent && !fileAbsolutePath) {
                  curNode = getNode(curNode.parent);
                  fileAbsolutePath =
                    curNode.fileAbsolutePath || curNode.absolutePath;
                  if (fileAbsolutePath) {
                    return fileAbsolutePath;
                  }
                }
                return undefined;
              },
            },
          },
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
            options: { maxWidth: 1024 },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],

This week we’ll **take** a look at all the steps required to make astonishing coffee with a Chemex at home. The Chemex Coffeemaker is a manual, pour-over style glass-container coffeemaker that Peter Schlumbohm invented in 1941, and which continues to be manufactured by the Chemex Corporation in Chicopee, Massachusetts.

In 1958, designers at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.spacefarm.digital) said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is _"one of the best-designed products of modern times"_, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

## The little secrets of Chemex brewing

<img src="/img/chémex.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px" />
<!-- <img src="../../static/img/chémex.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px" /> -->

The Chemex Coffeemaker consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing compound found in coffee oils.

## FAQs

### I'm getting the error: Field "image" must not have a selection since type "String" has no subfields

This is a common error when working with Netlify CMS (see issue [gatsby/gatsby#5990](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5990)).

The application must include the `media` with `gatsby-source-filesystem` to include all the uploaded media and to make it available on build time. **Note:** The media folder must be included **before** the other content.

For example, an application that is using NetlifyCMS and this plugin, and has a content folder with markdown that comes from Netlify. Here's how the `gatsby-config.js` should look like:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/static/assets`,
        name: 'assets',
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/content`,
        name: 'content',
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
      options: {
        plugins: [
          `gatsby-remark-relative-images`,
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
            options: {},
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms`,
  ],
};
```
